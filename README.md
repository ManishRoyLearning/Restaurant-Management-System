# Restaurant Management System  
Designed and developed a full-stack restaurant management platform with a GUI interface and secure cookie-based authentication. The system streamlines restaurant operations by integrating customer ordering, chef and waiter task management, and owner-level inventory and analytics control. Built using Node.js (Express, MVC), PostgreSQL, Bootstrap, Chart.js, and html2pdf.js, the application delivers a real-world simulation of restaurant workflows with features like order tracking, personalized recommendations, and interactive business insights.

## Highlights
- Created a GUI website application for a Restaurant Management System with cookie based login authentication
- The application creates an **ordering pipeline** (placing an order, alloting to a chef, then served by a waiter) that simulates a real-world restaurant system
- A customer can view his order history, *recommended* dishes, filter dishes based on cuisine and budget and place an order, chef/waiter can view profile and complete orders alloted
- The owner can view and update inventory and employee information, allot orders to chef/waiters and can view *analytics and graphs* on top dishes, top employees and statistics on profits, expenditure and wastage (Analytics filterable on date ranges)
- Used MVC architecture in **NodeJS (Express)**, PostgreSQL, Bootstrap, ChartJS, html2pdf.js
